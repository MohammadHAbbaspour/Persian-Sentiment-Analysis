## Sentiment Analysis for persian text
### This is our Deep Learning project which we should train a model for persian sentiment analysis. 
 For this, my contributor, [Mohammad Osoolian](https://github.com/mohammad-osoolian) and I fine tuned two LLM:
 - [bert-base-parsbert-uncased](https://huggingface.co/HooshvareLab/bert-base-parsbert-uncased)
 - [xlm-roberta-base](https://huggingface.co/FacebookAI/xlm-roberta-base)

 The dataset that we used is [ArmanEmo](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11808).
